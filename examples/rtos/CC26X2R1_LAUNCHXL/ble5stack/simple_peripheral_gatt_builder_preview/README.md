# Simple Peripheral GATT Builder

## How to use Gatt Builder Tool

To use the Gatt builder tool, please follow the steps below:

1) Add your services and characteristics to Syscfg `Custom Gatt` -> `Services`<br />
2) Implement the Read and Write CB functions and add them to your project. An example reference is on the `simple_gatt_profile.c` for the default service<br />
3) Enter the names of the CB functions (from section 2 above) to Syscfg, in `Write attribute CB function` and `Read attribute CB function`<br />
4) The names in section 3 (which we entered to the editor) must be identical to the names in section 2 (the names of the functions the user implemented on the main file)<br />
Note: in case the two CB functions (or one of them) are not implemented, the returning value from the CB will be SUCCESS<br />
5) Add a call to <YOUR_SERVICE_NAME>_AddService(uint32) on `simple_peripheral.c`. This should register the service on the BLE device.<br />
6) Build your project.

After doing the above instructions, you can build the project and see two files that were generated by Sysconfig, containing all the information added on the UI.
-	ti_services.c
-	ti_services.h

Below you can find a table that summarizes the key functions that are generated by the above templates:

| Function | Required/Optional | Remarks |
|---|---|---|
|  <YOUR_SERVICE_NAME>_AddService(uint32) |  Required for registering a service |  This function will add your service and all of its characteristics |
|  <YOUR_SERVICE_NAME>_GetParameter(uint8, void*) | Optional. Depends on the application use case  |  Gets a required parameter |
|  <YOUR_SERVICE_NAME>_SetParameter(uint8, uint8, void*) | Optional. Depends on the application use case  | Sets a required parameter
