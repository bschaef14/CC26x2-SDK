Porting From EasyLink 2.40.3 to EasyLink 2.50.1
=================================================

EasyLink 2.40.3 is bundled with the SimpleLink |DEVICEAND| **2.40** SDK. EasyLink 
2.50.1 is bundled with the SimpleLink |DEVICEAND| **3.10** SDK. 

For this migration guide, the rfEasyLinkTx project will be ported from EasyLink 
2.40.3 to EasyLink 2.50.1. The steps should be transferable for any EasyLink 
example project. 

This migration guide will explain how to port a :term:`SysConfig` example 
project. If you have a non-SysConfig enabled project, you can make the same 
adjustments directly in the file SysConfig would build (``easylink_config.c``, 
board files).

.. note::

	Non-SysConfig enabled projects will be deprecated from the |SDK| in a future 
	release. If you want to migrate your non-SysConfig enabled project to use 
	SysConfig, please see :ref:`syscfg-prop-migration`.

Because the directory structure is nearly identical between the two releases, the 
recommended approach is to start with a EasyLink 2.50.1 project that contains the 
same base functionality as the porting target project and merge in any custom 
functionality. 

#. Download and install CCS 9. 

   Previous versions of CCS is not supported by SysConfig in the SimpleLink 
   |DEVICEAND| 3.10 SDK

#. Choose a EasyLink 2.50.1 example project that contains your target projectâ€™s 
   base functionality. 

   For this example, we will use rfEasyLinkTx as the starting EasyLink 2.50.1
   example project. 

#. Transfer all modified application files from EasyLink 2.40.3 into the EasyLink 
   2.50.1 example project.

   In this example, the following files from EasyLink 2.40.3 were moved into 
   rfEasyLinkTx EasyLink 2.50.1 example:

		* ``rfEasyLinkTx.c``

#. Re-do .syscfg configuration.

   By opening your EasyLink 2.40.3 .syscfg file in one window and your EasyLink 
   2.50.1 .syscfg file you can re-do the SysConfig configurable parameters. Note 
   that while the groups have been slightly re-organized, the parameters stay the 
   same. You can read about configuring with SysConfig in 
   :ref:`sysconfig-easylink-configuration`.
