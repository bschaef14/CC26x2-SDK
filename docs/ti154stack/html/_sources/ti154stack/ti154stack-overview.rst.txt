Overview
========

TIâ€™s royalty-free |TIMAC| is a complete software platform for developing
applications that require extremely low-power, long-range, reliable, robust and
secure wireless star-topology based networking solutions. This chapter explains
in detail the different network-configuration modes supported by the TI
15.4-Stack for application development. Useful information is presented for
developers using the TI 15.4-Stack for their custom application development,
which lets developers quickly understand the basics of the selected
configuration mode and develop their end products with ease.

Architecture Choices
====================

|TIMAC| can be used in two separate architectures based on the end product
application. :numref:`fig-device-configuration` shows the two different system
architectures enabled by |TIMAC|.

-   A single device is shown in :numref:`fig-device-configuration` (left). The
    application and protocol stack are both implemented on the |DEVICE| as a
    true single-chip solution. This configuration is the simplest and most
    common when using the |DEVICE| for network nodes and also using the
    |DEVICE| as a personal area network (PAN) coordinator node. This
    configuration is the most cost-effective technique and provides the lowest-
    power performance.

-   A coprocessor is shown in :numref:`fig-device-configuration` (right). The
    protocol stack runs on the |DEVICE| while the application is executed on an
    external MPU or MCU. The application interfaces with the |DEVICE| using the
    network protocol interface (NPI) over a serial universal asynchronous
    receiver/transmitter (UART) connection. The description of the API interface
    is provided in the `TI 15.4-Stack CoP Interface Guide`_ document found in
    the ``docs/ti154stack`` folder of the SDK installation directory. This
    configuration is useful for applications that must add long-range wireless
    connectivity or peripheral applications, which execute on another device
    (such as an external MCU) or on a PC without the requirement to implement
    the complexities associated with a wireless networking protocol. In these
    cases, the application can be developed externally on a host processor while
    running |TIMAC| on the |DEVICE|, which provides ease of development and
    quickly adds long-range wireless connectivity to existing products.

Data-Rate and PHY
=================

The choice of PHY band and data rate can be made by setting the appropriate PHY
Id in ``ApiMac_attribute_phyCurrentDescriptorId`` PIB attribute. The overall
options are explained in :numref:`tab-phy-channels`

.. attention::
    When operating |TIMAC| at 2.4 GHz (PHY ID 0) the data-rate is locked at the
    standard IEEE 802.15.4 data-rate of 250kbps. Channel count starts at channel
    11 for this PHY.
