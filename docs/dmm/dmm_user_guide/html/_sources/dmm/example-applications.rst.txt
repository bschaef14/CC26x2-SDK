Example Applications
====================

This section provides an overview of the out-of-box example applications
available for DMM and what platforms each example support.

The DMM examples showcase different combinations of the supported TI stacks:
BLE, TI 15.4, Zigbee and EasyLink. The BLE connection is setup to demonstrate
how the application can be designed to interact with the second stack and its
network in order to provide features such as provisioning and reading out
network data.

The example applications provided for DMM are developed for |DEVICE| devices.
Which devices each example supports are described below. For which development
boards are supported, please refer to the example's README.


Example Application Design
--------------------------

In examples where there exists communication between the different stacks, an
"application communication interface" has been implemented. While each example
defines a unique set of actions in regards to stack-to-stack communication, all
of them use the same interface design concept.

In all examples, the BLE application is considered the "Interface master". In
the context of the interface, "master" simply refers to the application
responsible for implementing the interface while the "slave" is the other
stack.

For each interface, the interface master allows the slave to register a set of
callbacks that the master can use to interact with the slave. The set of
callbacks varies depending on the use case. In addition to the callbacks, the
master may define a few functions which the slave can use to interact with the
master.

For example, in the WSN Node + BLE Remote Display example, the WSN Node is
acting as the slave and can register callbacks for setting the report interval
and reading the current sensor value. The BLE application also provides an API
which the WSN Node can use to notify the BLE application that the sensor data
has been updated.

The sequence diagram below showcases the typical setup and usage of the
stack-to-stack interfaces. To see which callbacks and APIs that is available
for an example, see the BLE application ``remote_display.h`` header file.

Common User Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Common User Interface (:term:`CUI`) controls the access to User Interface
resources. On a LaunchPad, these resources are made up of Buttons, LEDs and UART
I/O. The CUI allows both of the two stack applications to use the resources. If
you want to read more about the CUI, you can see ``cui.h``.


2.4 GHz Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some of the DMM example projects have a ``*_2_4g`` suffix. These examples are
configured to use the 2.4 GHz PHY for the TI 15.4-Stack application. The
analogy would be the ``*_2_4g`` suffix TI 15.4-Stack example projects.

You can read more about the 2.4 GHz PHY for the TI 15.4-Stack in the `TI
15.4-Stack User's Guide`_.


OAD Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The examples that have ``oad`` as part of their names are enabled to do
over-the-air firmware upgrade (:term:`OAD`) over BLE. You can read more about
OAD in the `BLE5-Stack User's Guide`_.

SM Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^

Examples that have ``sm`` as part of their name showcase the TI 15.4 stack secure
commissioning feature. These examples uses a ``security manager`` which allows
secure commissioning  to a TI 15.4 network via a BLE central such as a smartphone.

The ``SimpleLink Starter`` mobile application has built in support for this
service and provides a graphical overview of the commissioning process. 
You can read more about how to use the mobile application in the example README 
files.

More information on the TI 15.4 Secure Commissioning feature can be found in the 
`TI 15.4-Stack User's Guide`_.

Block Mode Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most of the examples that operate at least one "end device" stack role allow 
for evaluation of the Block Mode feature. This include examples that implement 
at least one of the following stack roles:

* TI 15.4 Sensor
* BLE Peripheral
* Zigbee End-Device

For more information on how to use it for a given example, please see the 
``README.html`` included with the respective application source code.

Running the Applications

For information on how to run the example applications below, please see the
``README.html`` included with the respective application source code.


List of Example Applications
----------------------------

.. _sec-ble-easylink-remote-display-example-application:

WSN Node + BLE Remote Display Example Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**LaunchPads supported:** CC1352R, CC1352P-1/2/4

**Stack roles:** BLE Peripheral + EasyLink WSN Node

This example project showcases a Bluetooth 5 enabled EasyLink WSN Node. The BLE 
profile ``Remote Display`` can be used to interact with the WSN Node as well as 
the WSN Concentrator the node is connected to. For information on how to setup 
the WSN Concentrator, see the example README.

This example serves as a good starting point for developing a BLE +
Proprietary RF stack application.

**LaunchPads supported:** CC1352R, CC1352P-1/2/4

**Stack roles:** BLE Peripheral + EasyLink WSN Node

This example project showcases a combination of a Bluetooth 5 peripheral and an
EasyLink WSN node were both stacks operate independently of each other. This
serves as a demonstration of the minimum additions needed in order to combine
two stacks using the DMM. The DMM handles the scheduling of RF commands while
keeping the stacks unaware of each other.

.. note::

    When operating the TI 15.4 sensor in Frequency Hopping mode, provisioning 
    might cause the BLE connection to be dropped. In this case, the BLE 
    connection can be re-established once the sensor has joined the network.

Depending on what platform is used, different variants of the example are
available to showcase either a Sub-1 GHz or 2.4 GHz TI 15.4 sensor. The TI 15.4
Sensor can be configured to operate in either Non-beacon, Beacon or Frequency
Hopping mode. The default mode of operation for all TI 15.4 examples is
Non-beacon mode. How to change between the different modes are described in the
project README files.

.. note::
    
    The TI 15.4 Frequency Hopping mode within DMM applications is validated with 
    50 channels (Frequency Hopping Channel Mask and Frequency Hopping Asynchronous 
    Channel Mask).

**Sub-1 GHz TI 15.4 Sensor:** CC1352R, CC1352P-1/2/4
