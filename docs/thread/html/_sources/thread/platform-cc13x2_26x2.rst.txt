SimpleLink CC13x2_26x2 SDK Overview
***********************************

TI's royalty-free |SDK| is a complete software platform for developing
applications that require low-power, security, reliability, and mesh
networking. This kit is based on the |DEVICE| SimpleLink Wireless MCU. Visit
the `SimpleLink MCU Platform homepage <http://www.ti.com/simplelink>`_ for
more information about the SimpleLink ecosystem.

The SDK directory structure is broken down into a few major directories at
the root to allow easy differentiation between documentation, examples, kernel
source, and other source code. From the root directory, the sub-directories
are:

* **docs/**: All documentation for the SDK.
* **examples/**: Source code and project definitions for example projects in
  the SDK.
* **kernel/**: Source code and build tools for the kernels supported by the
  SDK.
* **source/ti/**: Source code from Texas Instruments, excluding the kernel.
* **source/third_party/**: Source code from third party vendors.
* **tools/**: Scripts and definition files used by the SDK.
